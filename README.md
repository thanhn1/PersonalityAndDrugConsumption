# Personality Traits And Drug Consumption
Understanding an individualâ€™s risk of drug consumption is critical. In this project, we look at the association between personality traits and drug consumption using a sample of 1885 individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. Our predictive models can be used by school staff when dealing with students as well as by healthcare professionals when dealing with patients.
